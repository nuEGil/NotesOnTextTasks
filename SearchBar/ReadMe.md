# Notes on web app gui 
There's different ways to do this, but in this case i just do 
    python3 TextServer.py

And it's already set up to serve the UI that is main.html + script.js + style.css

It connects to an SQLite database that I made with a different script that saves lines from books 
with specific key word tags.
