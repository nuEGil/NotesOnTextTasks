Each known or entity of interest is a node, and edges show relationships between the nodes. The edges are text based -- like verbs or other relationhip phrases....

You mus generate the output in a JSON format containing a list with JSON objects. Each object should have the keys: \"head\", \"head_type\", \"relation\", \"tail\", and 'tail_type\". here is one example:\n","---\n","Give the text : \"Adam is a software engineer in Microsoft since 2009\"\"\n","You can extract a relationship in the following format:\n","\n","{\n","  \"head\": \"Adam\",\n","  \"head_type\": \"person\",\n","  \"relation\": \"works_for\",\n","  \"tail\" : \"microsoft\",\n","  \"tail_type\": \"Company\"\n","}\n","\n","Results vary based on the llm out put. so use a good LLM.\n","\n","## personal thought\n","*My thought is that these knowledge graphs might be able to reveal what an LLM know if you apply it to LLM generated text. If you apply it to the data set, then you can get the complexity and content of the data set -- use graph approaches like path length searches, and counting the number of connections at eachc node --> now what happens when you apply it to image data? graphical approaches to image patches.*"],"metadata":{"id":"nH4eQ31oeqIH"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["She will have you use an API key, and then get it from an environment variable... interesting. keep it secret dont share it."],"metadata":{"id":"y0XkmJnmh84W"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import langchain"],"metadata":{"id":"yhhSE7pkhtg1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1757103458293,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":371,"user":{"displayName":"_ GIL","userId":"00678818275483713433"}}},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]}]}
